            <h3 class="text-lg my-4"> <span class="text-xl font-bold">var:</span><br>
                1. var declarations are function-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the function where
                they
                are defined. <br>
                2. If you declare a variable with var outside of a function, it becomes a global variable and is
                accessible
                throughout the entire program. <br>
                3. var variables are hoisted, meaning the declaration is moved to the top of the function or global
                scope
                during compilation, but the assignment remains in place. This can lead to unexpected behavior.</h3>


            <h3 class="text-lg my-4"> <span class="text-xl font-bold">let:</span><br>

                1. let declarations are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the nearest enclosing
                pair
                of
                curly braces {} (e.g., if statements, loops, functions, etc.). <br>

                2. Unlike var, let variables are not hoisted, so you can't access them before their declaration in the
                code.

            <h3 class="text-lg my-4"> <span class="text-xl font-bold">const:</span><br>

                1. const also has block scope like let, and it is used for variables whose values should not be
                reassigned after initialization. <br>
                2. Like let, const variables are not hoisted, and they must be initialized at the time of declaration.

            <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Use Cases of null and undefined:</h1>
            <h3 class="text-lg my-4"> <span class="text-xl font-bold">undefined:</span><br>
                1. undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value or an
                uninitialized variable. <br>
                2. Variables that have been declared but not assigned a value are automatically initialized to
                undefined. <br>
                3. It can also be the default return value of a function that does not explicitly return anything.

            </h3>
            <h3 class="text-lg my-4"> <span class="text-xl font-bold">null:</span><br>
                1. null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the intentional absence of any object value.
                <br>
                2. It is often used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or property should have no
                value. <br>
                3. It is commonly used in situations where you want to reset an object or variable to an empty or
                non-existent state.

                REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and a REST API (Application Programming Interface) is
